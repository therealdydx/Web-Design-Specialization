# Page Requests

Page requests are built out of the client-server relationship.

Servers: Machines that hold resources

Clients: Machines for personal use, i.e. laptops, phones, etc



We usually use networks as something called a LAN or a WAN:

- LAN: Local Area Network
- WAN: Wide Area Network



### URLs

Every URL has three parts:

1. The Protocol - How you want to connect
2. The Domain - The server
3. The Document

URLs are basically IP addresses that have been mapped to a name.



Protocols include HTTPS, HTTP, and FTP.

- HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol > Giving back and forth HTML Code
- FTP: File Transfer Protocol > Transferring Documents
