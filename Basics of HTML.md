# Basics of HTML

### Document Object Model

DOM is a way to stick by a standard when coding. 

New features should be based on HTML, CSS, the DOM and JavaScript.



The tree structure of the DOM comprises of the:

- Head
- Body



Doctype:

- Version of HTML that you're going to be using



Head:

Additional information used by the browser.

- Meta Data - Language, Title

- Supporting Files - JavaScript, Styling, Add-Ons

- Meta Data is not displayed other than the title

  

Body:

This is what people see, the bulk of the page.

- Most of the content is displayed by the browser



Example of Code:

'''

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang = "en">
<head>
    <meta charset = "UTF-8">
    <title>My First Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    This should be displayed by the browser.
</body>
</html>
</!doctype>
