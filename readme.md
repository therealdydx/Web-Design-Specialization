## Description of Courses

| No.  | Name                                    | Description                                                  |
| :--- | :-------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Introduction to HTML5                   | We will explore the theory (what actually happens when you click on a link on a webpage?), the practical (what do I need to know to make my own page?), and the overlooked (I have a page, what do I do now?). <br />Throughout the course there will be a strong emphasis on adhering to syntactic standards for validation and semantic standards to promote wide accessibility for users with disabilities. |
| 2    | Introduction to CSS3                    | This course will show you the basics of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3).  The emphasis will be on learning how to write CSS rules, how to test code, and how to establish good programming habits.     <br /><br />When done correctly, the styling of a webpage can take enhance your page. When done incorrectly the result can be worse than no styling at all. To ensure that your sites do not put up barriers for people with cognitive and/or physical disabilities, you will learn how to evaluate pages using the standardized POUR accessibility guidelines.<br /><br />Upon completion of the course, learners will be able to sketch a design for a given HTML page.  Using that design they will use CSS to implement the design by adding fonts, colors, and layouts. |
| 3    | Interactivity with JavaScript           | This course will introduce you to the basics of the JavaScript language.  We will cover concepts such as variables, looping, functions, and even a little bit about debugging tools.  <br /><br />You will understand how the Document Object Model (DOM) is used by JavaScript to identify and modify specific parts of your page.  After the course, learners will be able to react to DOM Events and dynamically alter the contents and style of their page. <br /><br />The class will culminate in a  final project - the creation of an interactive HTML5 form that accepts and verifies input. |
| 4    | Advanced Styling with Responsive Design | This course will expand upon the basic knowledge of CSS3 to include topics such as wireframes, fluid design, media queries, and the use of existing styling paradigms such as Bootstrap.  <br /><br />After the course, learners will be able to explain the mobile-first paradigm and the importance of wireframes in the design phase, create sites that behave across a range of platforms, and utilize existing design frameworks such as Bootstrap. |
| 5    | Web Design for Everybody Capstone       | The capstone will develop a professional-quality web portfolio.  Students will demonstrate the ability to design and implement a responsive site for a minimum of three platforms.  Adherence to validation and accessibility standards will be required. The evolving student implementations will be reviewed each week by capstone peers and teaching assistants to make sure that the student keeps up with the agenda of the course. <br /><br />Upon completion of this course students will feel comfortable creating and/or updating existing front-end sites, utilizing existing frameworks, and testing sites for accessibility compliance. |
